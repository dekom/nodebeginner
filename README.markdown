## The Application Stack ##
We're looking to create a complete web application. The parts we'll need are:

* HTTP Server: serve web pages
  Router: map requsts to request handlers
  Request handlers: fulfill requests
  Request data handling: treat incoming POST data and pass to request handlers
  in a convenient form
  View logic: create display content and send to user's browser
  Upload handling: take care of the details of handling (image) uploads
